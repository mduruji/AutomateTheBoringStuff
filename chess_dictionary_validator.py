"""
In this chapter, we used the dictionary value {'1h': 'bking', '6c': 'wqueen', '2g': 'bbishop',
'5h': 'bqueen', '3e': 'wking'} to represent a chess board. Write a function named
isValidChessBoard() that takes a dictionary argument and returns True or False depending on
if the board is valid.

A valid board will have exactly one black king and exactly one white king. Each player can
only have at most 16 pieces, at most 8 pawns, and all pieces must be on a valid space from
'1a' to '8h'; that is, a piece canâ€™t be on space '9z'. The piece names begin with either a 'w'
or 'b' to represent white or black, followed by 'pawn', 'knight', 'bishop', 'rook', 'queen', or
'king'. This function should detect when a bug has resulted in an improper chess board.
